Anchor text should be natural and varied to mimic organic linking patterns. Avoid over-optimization; focus on descriptive, user-friendly text that enhances relevance and click-through rates. Distribute anchor text types to prevent Penguin penalties.

## What to Avoid to Prevent Penalties

White-hat strategies require vigilance to avoid Google's penalties (e.g., Penguin for manipulative links). Focus on ethical practices that build long-term trust.

### Red Flags to Avoid

1. **Buying Links:** Never purchase backlinks from link farms or paid directories. This violates Google's guidelines and risks manual penalties.
2. **Over-Optimized Anchor Text:** Avoid >50% exact-match anchors; use varied, natural text to prevent algorithmic flags.
3. **Irrelevant Links:** Don't pursue links from unrelated sites (e.g., gambling blogs); focus on beauty/wellness relevance to maintain E-E-A-T.
4. **Link Schemes:** Avoid reciprocal link exchanges or link round robins; build links organically through value.
5. **Low-Quality Sources:** Steer clear of spammy sites (e.g., auto-generated content farms); prioritize editorial, user-focused sources.
6. **Excessive Link Velocity:** Don't acquire 100+ links in a month; natural growth is gradual (10-20/month max).
7. **Ignoring Disavow:** If low-quality links appear, use Google's Disavow Tool promptly.

### Risk Mitigation
- **Audit Regularly:** Monthly link audits with Ahrefs to identify risky links.
- **Diversify Sources:** 70% editorial, 30% other (e.g., directories).
- **Compliance Check:** Ensure all links are earned, not paid (disclose if sponsored).
- **Why Important:** Penalties can drop rankings 50-90%; prevention preserves SEO gains.
