# Topical Authority Map for Beauty & Wellness Services Booking Platform (BookEase)

**Niche:** Beauty and wellness services booking platform targeting India  
**Goal:** Establish BookEase as a topical authority in beauty/wellness booking, aligning with Google's E-E-A-T framework by providing comprehensive, trustworthy content that demonstrates expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness. This structure uses pillar-cluster model to build topical depth, improve internal linking for SEO, and target both informational (traffic) and transactional (money) keywords.

## Overview of Topical Authority Strategy

- **Pillar Pages:** Broad, authoritative pages covering high-level topics. These serve as hubs linking to cluster pages. Pillars target high-volume traffic keywords and establish expertise.
- **Cluster Pages:** Specific, detailed pages supporting pillars. They link back to pillars and target long-tail keywords, including money keywords for conversions.
- **Internal Linking Structure:** Clusters link to pillars (and vice versa where relevant). Use descriptive anchor text (e.g., "learn more about beauty services booking"). Aim for 3-5 internal links per page to distribute link equity.
- **Traffic vs. Money Keywords:**
  - **Traffic Keywords:** Informational queries driving visits (e.g., "what is a facial", "benefits of massage"). Target in pillars and guides.
  - **Money Keywords:** Transactional queries driving bookings (e.g., "book facial in Mumbai", "haircut booking near me"). Target in service detail pages and location clusters.
- **Publishing Order:** Start with pillars to build foundation, then clusters for depth. Prioritize high-impact pages first.
- **Authority Design:** Include user reviews, expert guides, structured data, and local focus to signal E-E-A-T. Ensure content is original, comprehensive, and user-focused.
