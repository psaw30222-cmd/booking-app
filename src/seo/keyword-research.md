# Keyword Research (initial prioritized list)

## Target cities (primary + long-tail)
- escorts in delhi — high intent, target primary city landing page
- call girls delhi — transactional
- escort service delhi — transactional
- delhi companion service — transactional
- escorts in mumbai — primary
- call girls mumbai
- escorts in bangalore
- escorts in pune

## Service-focused keywords
- VIP escort delhi
- massage escort delhi

- incall escort delhi

## Long-tail & question keywords (good for blog / FAQ)
- how to book an escort in delhi
- are escort services safe in delhi
- verified escorts delhi
- best escort services in delhi for couples

## Competitor gap opportunities
- City+service long-form guides (e.g., "Best escorts in Delhi: Area guide & safety tips")
- High-quality unique images + city-specific profiles
- Local citations (Google Business, city directories where allowed)

## Recommended next steps
1. Use an SEO tool (Ahrefs/SEMrush/Keywords Everywhere) to get search volume & difficulty for the above terms — prioritize low-medium difficulty long-tail phrases first.
2. Map top 20 keywords to pages (city landing pages, service detail pages, blog posts).  
3. Update title/meta/URL to include primary keyword near the front (e.g., "Escorts in Delhi — Verified Companions | BookEase").
4. Create 6-8 long-form topical pages per city + 2 pillar blog posts.
